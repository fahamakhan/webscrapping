ASPIRE AVP AIO POD SYSTEM KIT,"
                  The Aspire AVP AIO Pod System has a stylish and multiangular design constructed of zinc alloy and featuring carbon fiber-like panels. A hexagon shaped single button acts as the battery life indicator, a simple on or off switch with five clicks, and the output wattage cycle with two clicks. The AVP can be adjusted to 3 different wattage settings with just a couple clicks of the button. The output wattage can be set to 8W, 10W, or 12W, giving you plenty of options to suit your vaping preferences, while also allowing the wattage remain constant regardless of the level of charge in the battery. The AVP pod replacment can accommodate a maximum 2ml of e-liquid, and attaches to the device with strong magnetic connections. Filling the pod is simple; locate the silver slot on the bottom and push down with the tip of your juice bottle. This receding metal piece also acts as a safety precaution and to prevent juice from leaking. Internally, the AVP Pod utilizes a nichrome coil with 1.2 ohm resistance, perfectly suited for high resistance, mouth to lung vaping.  Colors: Grey, Orange Black, Rainbow, Purple Aspire AVP AIO Kit Includes: (1) Aspire AVP Device(2) Aspire AVP Refillable Pods(1) Micro USB Cable(1) Lanyard(1) Warranty Card(1) User Manual Aspire AVP AIO Kit Features: - Built-in 700mAh rechargeable battery- 2ml refillable pod with 1.2 ohm integrated nichrome coil- Draw activated firing- BYPASS mode- 3 stage power adjustment button- Zinc-aluminum alloy construction- Proprietary magnetic connection- Automatic cutoff- Short-circuit protection- Overcharge protection- Over heat protection- LED battery life indicator- Micro USB charging port Aspire AVP AIO Kit Specifications: Dimensions: 82mm x 39mm x 14mmCapacity: 2mlCoil Resistance: 1.2 ohmsWattage Output: 8W, 10W, & 12W - Dependent on selected mode.Recommended VG/PG Ratio: 70/30 VG/PGWARNING: Please

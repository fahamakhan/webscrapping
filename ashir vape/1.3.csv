YOCAN FALCON KIT,"
                 Yocan is a brand that loves to redesign vaporizers and reinvent the way we see vaping, whether it’s consuming wax concentrates or dry herb strains. The Yocan Falcon Vaporizer is a device designed to cover all facets of vaping, and even add the element of water filtration and moisture conditioning to your daily sessions. The Yocan Falcon Vaporizer comes with a powerful 1000mAh battery that works in conjunction with a slew of heating elements including the brand’s latest quartz tri coil for wax concentrates and their pancake coil for dry herbs. You can also use Yocan’s proprietary XTAL Coils which allows you to use the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer as a nectar collector to help you consume larger dabs for more satisfying hits. On that note, the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer comes with its own dish and metal jar where you can store your concentrates and dab straight from the dish. All built with magnetic connection to promote simplicity and ease of use. The Yocan Falcon Vaporizer is one of the best and the most practical devices on the market that’s perfect for both beginners and advanced consumers. It gives you all the necessary tools you need to get started whether you’re a fan of consuming botanical plant matter or its waxy derivative.Superior BatteryThe Yocan Falcon Vaporizer is outfitted with a 1000mAh that’s perfect for a device like the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer that’s built to be an on-the-go unit. With a battery that’s widely compatible with different heating elements, having one with a beefy capacity is somewhat of a must. The quartz tri coils and the pancake coils can be demanding atomizers when it comes to power. Nevertheless, having more than enough juice to last you significant sessions in between charges is important. That's why the folks at Yocan gave emphasis to longevity and overall superiority when it comes to heating and extracting the active ingredients from both wax concentrates and select botanical dry herb strains. So, whatever the demand is in vaping, the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer has definitely got you covered. The battery is even great for quick group sessions as it can withstand several cycles you you and your friends are in for partaking.In terms of size, a battery as beefy as the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer deserves to have a larger size. Consequentially, the increased bulk works in the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer’s favor as the battery looks and feels sturdy and can handle minor wear and tear from daily use and carrying activity. The Yocan Falcon Vaporizer offers a battery that can last as good as it looks.Multi-Functional VaporizerThe Yocan Falcon Vaporizer is a multi-functional vaporizer that can be used in 6 different ways. All involving the use of simple and straightforward operation that even a beginner, let alone an advanced consumer, can work out how to use the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer. Below are just some of the means of how you can use the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer.1. XTAL Tip with Glass Attachment.This method of using the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer allows you to connect the XTAL Tip and work the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer like you would a nectar collector. Simply turn the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer on and hover the XTAL Tip on the wax concentrates and you’re good to go. The Glass attachment also helps smoothen out the vapor by using water filtration and moisture conditioning.2. Quartz Tri Coil with Glass Attachment.The Yocan Falcon Vaporizer can be used with the quartz tri coil for a relatively familiar experience but with a twist. You get the same powerful performance as you would with a traditional dab pen but you also get the benefits of having the vapors filtered and moisturized using the glass attachment that can accommodate water.3. Pancake Style Coil with Glass Attachment.If you’ve been consuming weed, you’d know that it hits hard but it comes with a certain harshness. Using the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer this way lets you still reap the benefits of consuming herbs but lets you eliminate the harshness of consuming ground botanical plant matter. This way you can still enjoy your daily rituals but you no longer have to cough your lungs out in the process.The first three options of using the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer may not be entirely portable because the glass attachment can get in the way of carrying the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer. The next three leans more on the portable side as they can be used without the glass attachment.4. XTAL Tip.The same way you use the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer as a nectar collector but this time without the glass attachment. And while this omits the element of water filtration, it ensures you get a portable version of the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer.5. Quartz Tri Coil.Like a traditional dab pen, the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer when paired with the quartz tri coil offers a traditional experience. Pretty much like using any of the brand’s dab pens, the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer makes for a great bad pen for on-the-go use.6. Pancake Coil.The Yocan Falcon Vaporizer can vaporize select dry herb strains using its pancake coils. Like its Yocan Evolve-D predecessors, the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer can be used to consume select botanicals on-the-go. It's also fairly easy and straightforward.Preset Temperature LevelIf you think the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer’s ability to customize and personalize your sessions ends there, you’ll be surprised to know that this device also comes with variable voltage settings. This means that you can easily alter the level of voltage the battery uses to heat your preferred materials. However, it’s mainly used as temperature directly affects the quality of vapor the Yocan Falcon Vaporizer produces.The lowest temperature setting is at around 3.2 volts. The medium setting at 3.7 volts while the highest is at 4.2 volts. The lowest temperature setting lets you enjoy flavorful vapors from your favorite materials while the highest temperature setting allows the extraction of the potent active ingredients of your materials. You can simply select amongst the available temperature settings depending on your preference.What’s in the box:1 x Yocan Falcon Vaporizer1 x Metal Mouthpiece1 x XTAL Tip1 x Pancake Coil1 x Pick Tool1 x Cleaning Brush1 x Mini Cleaning Brush1 x USB-C Cable1 x Multi-Functional Holder1 x User ManualWARNING: Please have a

The Vision Spinner stands somewhere between an e-cig and a more advanced personal vaporizer due to its variable voltage dial that ranges from 3.3-4.8V. The dial is located at the base of the battery and has markings with incremental dashes to indicate the current voltage-output. Spinning the dial clockwise increases the voltage and vice versa, and pressing the fire button five times will power the device on. To turn the Vision Spinner off, simply click the firing button five times again. If you’re looking to get the best possible battery life out of this device, using a lower voltage (both when in-use and not in use) might significantly help extend the overall battery life . A small LED light will indicate that the device is plugged in and will turn green once the battery is charged completely. Utilizing smart buck-boost technology, the Vision Spinner has short circuit protection, low voltage protection, and an 8 second safety cutoff that’ll automatically cut the power to the device after holding the fire button down for 8 seconds. Attach any compatible tank to the eGo 510 connection and experience the simple joy of vaping with the Vision Spinner VV 1300mAh.Ce4 900mah Blister Kit Features:
